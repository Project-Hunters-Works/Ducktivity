                <p>SQ3R (or SQRRR) is an acronym that stands for the five steps of the reading comprehension process</p>

            <p>SQRRR or SQ3R is a reading method that helps to process text, understand its meaning and integrate with what the reader already knows.This method was introduced by Francis P.Robinson in his book Effective Study (1946).</p>
            <p>This method is very efficient when you need to read textbook material. The information you gain from reading is important. Therefore you need to focus while reading.
            </p>

            <h2>Process</h2>
            <p> Try these steps for a more efficient and effective study session.</p>
            <h3>1. Survey(S)</h3>
            <p>Instead of start to read book or material that you suppose to read , first check chapters and note headings, sub-headings and features like tables, marginal information and summary paragraphs. Survey step supposed to take 3-5 minutes of your precious time. This step will provide you framework and you can create questions about it which is next step.
            </p>
            <h3>2. Question(Q)</h3>
            <p>Start to generate questions about content of reading. You had already survey framework and you can do brainstorming about it. After that try to look answers of those questions. For example , you can ask :
                <ol>
                    <li>What is this chapter about?</li>
                    <li>What question is this chapter trying to answer?</li>
                    <li>How does this information help me?</li>
                </ol>
            </p>
            <h3>3. Read (R1)</h3>
            <p>Start reading according to questions that you asked in Question Stage. You will try to give answer about questions and you will merely read without engaging deeply with the study material.You can also take notes with your own words and connect them with sections that you found in Survey Stage.
            </p>
            <h3>4. Recite(R2)</h3>
            <p>After the Read Stage, you need to activate your memory and recite what you learned from read stage. You need to use your own words to answer questions from second stage. You supposed to act like you are teaching those materials to other person. Try to recall and identify major points. This will help you to boost your long-term memory.
            </p>
            <h3>5. Review(R3)</h3>
            <p>Once you have finished the chapter, itâ€™s important to review the material to fully understand it. Quiz yourself on the questions you created and re-read any portions you need to.</p>
            <h2>Pros</h2>
            <ol>
            <li>Understanding what passage says</li>
            <li>Reflecting with your own words</li>
            <li>Visualisation</li>
            <li>Mindfullness</li>
            </ol>
            <h2>Cons</h2>
            <ol>
            <li>The method is time-intensive as it requires you to dedicate enough time to comprehend each chapter and analyse all headings.</li>
            <li>The SQ3R method can be difficult to learn and apply.</li>
            </ol>
