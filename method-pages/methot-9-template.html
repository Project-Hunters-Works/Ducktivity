            <p>In business, communication needs to be clear and efficient. People are busy and don't have time to read
                long walls of text or listen to long presentations where the key info is shared at the very end.

                Use the Minto Pyramid to give your communication a top-down structure and get your message across
                quickly and clearly. Lead with the conclusion, then provide key arguments and finally support them with
                detailed information.</p>
            <img src="./images/home-page-hero-refreshed-v3.avif" alt="">
            <h2>How it works</h2>
            <p>See what I did there? I shared the main takeaway with you already. That's the idea of this tool – cutting
                to the chase. Now let's look at it in more detail.</p>
            <h3>1. Start with the conclusion</h3>
            <p>Capture your audience's attention early on by first telling them the main takeaway, message,
                recommendation or simply your conclusion. This may be the opposite to how we've been taught to
                communicate but it's more efficient, especially in writing and with audiences who have limited time or
                attention.This principle is also called BLUF – "bottom line up front". It originated in the military but is now widely used in the business world.</p>
            <h3>2. Provide key points</h3>
            <p>With the main takeaway already communicated, it's time to support it with key arguments or main points.
                These should still be fairly short. Write them as summaries of your main points. This part should
                explain the "why" behind your conclusion or recommendation.</p>
            <h3>3. Support points with detailed information</h3>
            <p>You might still need to make your key points credible. Do that by giving more detailed information that
                support them: facts, evidence, numbers, results. This is the part where you can really go into detail if
                you want to.
                The busier people are, the more likely they are to skip this part but sometimes it's necessary in order
                for the conclusion to be accepted or acted on.Sometimes, you might want to skip the detailed information if your key arguments are enough to justify your conclusion and you know that your audience will understand them well enough.</p>
            <h2>Example</h2>
            <p>It's always best to see how such a tool looks like in practice. Let's see an example of a researcher who
                just completed a study and wants to share the results with their colleagues, along with their
                recommendation. Here's how you might write a message to your team using the Minto Pyramid tool:</p>
                <img src="../images/Minto pyramid example.png" alt="">
                <p>As you can see, there's a very clear recommendation given up front. It's explained with the key findings and those are supported by detailed data, evidence and results. This way, the audience immediately gets the most important information first. They only need to consume the details if they choose to, not in order to get to the main point.</p>
            <h2>Takeaway</h2>
            <p>To sum up, the Minto Pyramid is a tool to give your (written) communication more clarity and efficiency. You'll lead with the conclusion, provide key arguments and support them with details. Your busy audience will thank you.</p>
